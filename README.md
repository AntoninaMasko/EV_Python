# Electric Vehicles in the European Union analysis

## Summary
New cars sold in the European Union (EU) must be zero-emission starting from 2035. This means that the sales of new electric vehicles (EV) in the EU should increase over the next years.
The analysis of the sales and stock of the EV might show the current trend in each country, as well as if there is any relation between the income, GDP or population of each country and the sales.

## Data
### Data sorce
The data has been sourced from the Eurostat (European Statistical Office), whose main responsibilities are to provide statistival information to the institutions of the EU and promote the harmonization of statistical methods across the member countries as well as EFTA countries.

### Data limitation
Data is unfortunately only until 2021, which for the analysis might be quite old. 

There is no data of the vehicles by car brand, which prevents us from creating further analysis, e.g. popularity and sales of the cars by price/brand.

## Storyboard
The storyboard is in Tableau:

It doesnâ€™t contain every step I took as part of the analysis in Python, but only those relevant to the final results.
